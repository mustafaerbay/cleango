package user
/*
This example shows a simple implementation of the User model, 
which is used to represent a user in the application. 
The User struct contains four fields - ID, FirstName, LastName, and Email - 
which are used to store the user's identifying information.

Note that this example assumes that the user package has already been defined, 
and that the necessary dependencies have been imported. In a real-world application, 
there may be additional fields or methods defined on the User struct, depending on the 
requirements of the application.

	ID        string `json:"id"`
	FirstName string `json:"first_name"`
	LastName  string `json:"last_name"`
	Email     string `json:"email"`
}
